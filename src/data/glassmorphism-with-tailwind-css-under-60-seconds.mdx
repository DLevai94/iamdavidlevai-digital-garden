If you prefer a quick 1 min video:

Glassmorphism is an ongoing trend right now in User interfaces. The new macOS, Big Sur brings a lot of it into the OS, and Microsoft has it for years with Aero UI, then later FluentUI.


To recreate this effect on the web, we only need a few css properties, but what if we want to use our loved Tailwind?

We need these utility classes: `bg-opacity-{xy}`, `bg-clip-padding`, `bg-{color}`. We can add a little border and shadow to look better with these: `border border-{color}`, `shadow-{size}`.

And to completely recreate the effect, we should blur the background. We've got 2 options here:

### 1. Inline styles
Add a style property to the card div: `style="backdrop-filter: blur(20px);"`.

[You can access the full code here](https://play.tailwindcss.com/LTnkNgDSLj)

### 2. Extend Tailwind
We can use [Tailwindcss-filters](https://github.com/benface/tailwindcss-filters) to extend it and use `backdrop-filter` as a utility class.

Just `yarn add tailwindcss-filters`, then extend your `tailwind.config` file:

```js:tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    backdropFilter: {
      'none': 'none',
      'blur': 'blur(20px)',
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    require('tailwindcss-filters'),
  ],
};
```

And now you can use the `backdrop-filter-blur` utility class on your HTML.
